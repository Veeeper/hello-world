I am new, know nothing about code and am just trying to automate
My home. Right now I am fighting with sonoff
Snzb-03 motion sensors, a quickset 910 lock and a Haven ble floor lock
None of which want to be. Found by my smartthings hub the 2nd gen I think it has batteries , it's square and hooked up by a Lan cor
.it seems all my devices are found by other apps but in smart things it says hub connected but devices 0
Ugh I'm frustrated. Thanks for listening.
